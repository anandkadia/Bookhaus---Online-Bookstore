This book faces up to the impacts of making materials in the 21st century. We are already making materials well, but demand keeps growing and we need to plan for a sustainable material future. The steel and aluminium industries alone account for nearly 30 per cent of global emissions, and demand is rising. The world target is to reduce industry\'s carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2050. However, projections are that world demand for materials will double by 2050, so to meet our emissions target, we have to achieve a 4-fold reduction in emissions per unit of material used: industry will have to make huge changes, not just to the processes involved, but to the entire product life-cycle. This book presents a vision of change for how future generations can still use steel, cement, plastics etc., but with less impact on the environment. First it is a wake-up call, then it is a solutions manual. The solutions presented here are ahead of the game now. By providing an evidence-based vision of change, this book can play a significant role in influencing our energy future.'),(46,'978-8463788567','Great Escapes Around the World Vol. 2','Angelika Taschen',30,'2007-10-04','Taschen Benedikt Verlag Gmbh.','B46.png','travel','The second installment of Angelika Taschen\'s round-up of the world\'s most exceptional hotels and retreats is packed with awe-inspiring photos and tantalizing descriptions of the world\'s greatest getaways.
